# Rust Exercise

I'm learning Rust as my language of choice for embedded systems. I'll be creating various small programs to help me learn the langauge. I've created this repository to document this process.

## About Me

My name is Jaylen Douglas, I'm a software engineer with over half-a-decade of professional experience. My languages of choice are Python and Javascript/NodeJS - with experience in Java and learning Rust. I love music and creating products. I believe a good engineer is someone who asks all the questions; the obvious and not, someone with patience and someone willing to do the thing even if they don't know how.

A Favorite quote (not sure who said it): "We were all the new guy, once"

## Progress So Far

Here's a list of what's in the repo so far

* Secrets Generator (secrets-generator) - Create randomized secrets of a given length with or without special characters. What's I've learned from this: 
    - String manipulation (concatenation, formatting)
    - Basic for loop
    - Using dependencies with Cargo (rand library)
    - Doc strings
    - Scope and namespaces
